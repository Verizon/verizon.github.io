## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To get started editing this site, you'll need Node v12+. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Once that's installed, you'll need [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) as well.

Start developing by initializing your node modules:

```shell
yarn
```

Then start the [gatsby development server](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/):

```shell
yarn build
yarn develop
```

Plenty of information may show, but you should eventually see something like:

```shell
You can now view gatsby-starter-default in the browser.
â €
  http://localhost:8000/
â €
```

You can edit the site by editing the files in `src/`. This site uses CSS, JS, and [css-in-js](https://cssinjs.org/).

> ðŸ’¡ Note that for most images, you'll want to run `yarn build` before they show up correctly on the development site.
